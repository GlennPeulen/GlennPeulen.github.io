<ul>
  <li>Blue Period.</li>
  <li>Calling someone talented undermines the long hours of hardwork that they put in to achieve something. It disrespects the amount of time and effort they have put into achieving or mastering something. Some people on the other hand, are naturally talented for something. This maybe the result of their conditioning, upbringing or their genetic make up. This induces some level of healthy competitive jealousy among the hardworking overachievers. They plan to work so hard that no one would be able to tell the different between the work of a hardworker and a talented individual.</li>
  <li>This is the major takeaway of blue period.</li>
