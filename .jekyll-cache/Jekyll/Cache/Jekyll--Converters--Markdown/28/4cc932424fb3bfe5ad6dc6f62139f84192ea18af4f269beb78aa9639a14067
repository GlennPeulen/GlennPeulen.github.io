I"…<p>Today is my first day of writing. I will write at least 500 words for the next 100 days. I am sure I will be able to achieve this goal. A major aim of this exercise is to get into a habit of writing and potentially improve it further, while also having fun and just churning out some interesting pieces. In this way, I also get an opportunity to document some snapshots of my life.</p>
