This is my first blog. COVID numbers in India are rising. We have successfully flatten the curve along the vertical axis. In the wake of the renewed way, the government decided to make India a COVID vaccine importer rather than an exporter. Congratulations Guys! We have successfully demonstrated the robustness of "Make in India". Don't get me wrong. India's market and business houses are amazing, but India's large beaurocrary prides in itself for governing (rather controlling) and controlling the world's largest and most complex democrary. All the best dealing with the corrupt, power hungry, power drunk beaurocracy. 

Stay safe, Take care and have a great day! (My equivalent of Like, Share and Subscribe...)
