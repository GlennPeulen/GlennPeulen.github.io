# 22 Lessons from early half of 2022
 *Taken from twitter thread of Sahil Bloom [link here](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1543229640155725826)*


 - **Parent Time**: You'll only see your loved ones a few more times. The time we have with our parents is limited -- the vast majority of it behind you by the time you leave school. Don't hide from the scary math -- make changes to prioritize time with loved ones.
 - **5 Types of wealth**
   - Financial (money)
   - Social (relationships)
   - Physical (health)
   - Mental (knowledge, faith)
   - Time (freedom)
   The pursuit of financial wealth can rob you of the others. Do not let that happen.
 - **Intellectual Chemistry**
 Agreement doesn't create growth—disagreement does. Build a circle of friends with whom you have intellectual chemistry—the ability to enjoy disagreements with one another. Active tension sharpens thinking.
 - **Flywheels** 
 A flywheel is a positive momentum loop. Once it gets going, its momentum helps, increasinig the impact of the applied effort. To get it moving, you need:
  - Force (intensity)
  - Duration (consistency)
  - Angle (intelligent)
 - **The Power of Tiny Gains** 
 Compounding is one of the most beautiful tings in the world. But it can work for or against you. Extraordinary achievements are often just the end result of a large volume of consistent tiny actions. Small things become big things.
 - **The Advice Paradox** 
 Taking more advice leaves you less well-equipped. It's well-intentioned, but it's dangerous to use someone else's map of reality to navigate yours. Winners learn to filter and selectively implement advice - take the signal, skip the noise. 
 - **Intellectual Sparring Partners**
