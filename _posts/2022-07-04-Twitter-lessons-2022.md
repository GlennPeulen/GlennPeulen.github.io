# 22 Lessons from early half of 2022
 *Taken from twitter thread of Sahil Bloom [link here](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1543229640155725826)*


 - **Parent Time**: You'll only see your loved ones a few more times. The time we have with our parents is limited -- the vast majority of it behind you by the time you leave school. Don't hide from the scary math -- make changes to prioritize time with loved ones.
 - **5 Types of wealth**
   - Financial (money)
   - Social (relationships)
   - Physical (health)
   - Mental (knowledge, faith)
   - Time (freedom)
   The pursuit of financial wealth can rob you of the others. Do not let that happen.
 - **Intellectual Chemistry**
 Agreement doesn't create growth—disagreement does. Build a circle of friends with whom you have intellectual chemistry—the ability to enjoy disagreements with one another. Active tension sharpens thinking.
 - **Flywheels** 
 A flywheel is a positive momentum loop. Once it gets going, its momentum helps, increasinig the impact of the applied effort. To get it moving, you need:
  - Force (intensity)
  - Duration (consistency)
  - Angle (intelligent)
 - **The Power of Tiny Gains** 
 Compounding is one of the most beautiful tings in the world. But it can work for or against you. Extraordinary achievements are often just the end result of a large volume of consistent tiny actions. Small things become big things.
 - **The Advice Paradox** 
 Taking more advice leaves you less well-equipped. It's well-intentioned, but it's dangerous to use someone else's map of reality to navigate yours. Winners learn to filter and selectively implement advice - take the signal, skip the noise. 
 - **Intellectual Sparring Partners**
 Most of us need fewer friends and more intellectual sparring partners. Friends are easy to come by - intellectual sparring partners are harder to find. They are willing to call you on your BS, questions your assumptions, and push you to think deeply.
 - **The Regret Razor**
 When choosing how to spend your time, choose to spend it on time you never regret. A few things I never regret: 
  - Creative sprint
  - Talking to smart friends
  - Calling my parents
  - Tech-free walks
  - Exercising
  Make your list - then spend more time on it!
 - **Identity Capital**
 Identity capital is the base of experiences and traits that make us unique. When you are young, seek to build identity capital - pursue interesting experiences as much as you can. As you grow, leverage your identity capital to accelerate your career and life. 
 - **Question-Action Matrix**
 Asking great questions uncovers the truth - bias for action builds upon it. The four quadrants:
  - Q1: World-changers (rare!)
  - Q2: Grinders/hustlers
  - Q3: Philosophers/thinkers
  - Q4: Dead Zone
 Invest behind Q1s, hire more Q2s, spend time with Q3s, and avoid Q4s.
