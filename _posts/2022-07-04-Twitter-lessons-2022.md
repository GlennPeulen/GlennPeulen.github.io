# 22 Lessons from early half of 2022
 *Taken from twitter thread of Sahil Bloom [link here](https://twitter.com/SahilBloom/status/1543229640155725826)*


 1. **Parent Time** You'll only see your loved ones a few more times. The time we have with our parents is limited -- the vast majority of it behind you by the time you leave school. Don't hide from the scary math -- make changes to prioritize time with loved ones.
 2. **5 Types of wealth**
   - Financial (money)
   - Social (relationships)
   - Physical (health)
   - Mental (knowledge, faith)
   - Time (freedom)
   The pursuit of financial wealth can rob you of the others. Do not let that happen.
 3. **Intellectual Chemistry**
 Agreement doesn't create growth—disagreement does. Build a circle of friends with whom you have intellectual chemistry—the ability to enjoy disagreements with one another. Active tension sharpens thinking.
 4. **Flywheels** 
 A flywheel is a positive momentum loop. Once it gets going, its momentum helps, increasinig the impact of the applied effort. To get it moving, you need:
   - Force (intensity)
   - Duration (consistency)
   - Angle (intelligent)
 5. **The Power of Tiny Gains** 
 Compounding is one of the most beautiful tings in the world. But it can work for or against you. Extraordinary achievements are often just the end result of a large volume of consistent tiny actions. Small things become big things.
 6. **The Advice Paradox** 
 Taking more advice leaves you less well-equipped. It's well-intentioned, but it's dangerous to use someone else's map of reality to navigate yours. Winners learn to filter and selectively implement advice - take the signal, skip the noise. 
 7. **Intellectual Sparring Partners**
 Most of us need fewer friends and more intellectual sparring partners. Friends are easy to come by - intellectual sparring partners are harder to find. They are willing to call you on your BS, questions your assumptions, and push you to think deeply.
 8. **The Regret Razor**
 When choosing how to spend your time, choose to spend it on time you never regret. A few things I never regret: 
  - Creative sprint
  - Talking to smart friends
  - Calling my parents
  - Tech-free walks
  - Exercising
  Make your list - then spend more time on it!
 9. **Identity Capital**
 Identity capital is the base of experiences and traits that make us unique. When you are young, seek to build identity capital - pursue interesting experiences as much as you can. As you grow, leverage your identity capital to accelerate your career and life. 
 10. **Question-Action Matrix**
 Asking great questions uncovers the truth - bias for action builds upon it. The four quadrants:
  - Q1: World-changers (rare!)
  - Q2: Grinders/hustlers
  - Q3: Philosophers/thinkers
  - Q4: Dead Zone
 Invest behind Q1s, hire more Q2s, spend time with Q3s, and avoid Q4s.
 11. **The Brakes Paradox**
 What allows a F1driver to fly around the track?
 It's not the engine, the tires or the suspension. It is the brakes. Strong, reliable brakes unlock the driver. Build brakes into your life that allow you to accelerate and hit turns without fear.
 12. **Creative Boredom**
 Experiencing regular periods of boredom is a competitive advantage. Your most creative moments come duringg bouts of boredom. Try the creative boredom challenges:
  - 5 days, 30 min per day
  - No tech
  - No books
  - Alone, walking or static
 You won't regret it.
 13. **Darkest Hour Friends**
 Most of your friends aren't really your friends. They're just along for the ride when it's fun or valuable - they'll disappear when it's not. Your real friends are there when you have nothing to offer in return. 
 14. **Luck Surface Area**
 Your habits put you in a position where luck is more likely to strike. It's hard to get lucky watching TV at home. If you want to get lucky, increase your luck surface area. Open up the aperature to let more luck in- eliminate "black holes" that block it.
 15. **The Writing Knife Block**
 Writing is the ultimate tool to sharpen thinking. When you write, you expose the gaps that exist in your logic and thinking. 

 Use writing as a "knife block":
 When you think you understand something, write it out and put your understanding to the test.
