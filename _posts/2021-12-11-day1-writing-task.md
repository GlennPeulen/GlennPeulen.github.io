Today is my first day of writing. I will write atleast a 100 words for the next 100 days. I am sure I will be able to achieve this goal. A major aim of this exercise is to get into a habbit of writing and potentially improve it further, while also have fun and just churn out some interesting pieces. In this way, I also get an opportunity to document some snapshots of my life.
