Today is my first day of writing. I will write at least 500 words for the next 100 days. I am sure I will be able to achieve this goal. A major aim of this exercise is to get into a habit of writing and potentially improve it further, while also having fun and just churning out some interesting pieces. In this way, I also get an opportunity to document some snapshots of my life.

Today, Koala messaged me asking if I got an email from GT's program. Initially, I went in a defensive mode, asserting the fact that both of us are applying to different programs. She said that the program committee wants to have an "informal chat" with her. Following this, her replies included justifications for her actions and that she was only planning to prepare for the interviews. My response later was kind. I congratulated and wished her good luck for whatever followed. I also messaged chu and tried justifying my actions. He felt too important and I acted like a fuckin simp. I should have taken a stand. Maybe it's fine, I am just being kind to people. KN proposed that we meet at the citadel on nine tails adding to the ten teeth. Most of the replies were negative. Let's see what follows. 

On the academic front, I am learning IML. I covered linear models and will probably be done with decision trees. I think I feel a bit more confident after looking at GAM. Maybe I can model the gene expression data and make some interesting clean methods for single-cell. Woah, I am thinking everything in the light of single-cell datasets lol. Okay, I need to stay away from social media lingo. 

I am thinking of including the latex plugin here too. I can bang out equations here and save it handy. I can even use this website as my personal notes storage space for free! No one really care if the website is listed. Anyways, most of the website out there are thrash. It would be an online treasure for me, with almost complete annonymity. Now I see why bhondoo created his anonymous blog.
